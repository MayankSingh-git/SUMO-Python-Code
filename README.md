File 1: The generation of the route file for each track has been accomplished using a Python script. Consequently, a comprehensive Python code for one track has been included herein. For the remaining tracks, appropriate modifications can be made as required.

File 2: Gives the Count of vehicles (Once Total vehicles and then cars and trucks separately) every 60 seconds with a displacement of 5 seconds between Intervals passing through different observational points such as 100m, 200m, 300m, and 400m.

File 3: Gives the Count of vehicles present on the road segment of 420m and their respective aggregate Speed at every 60 sec, with a displacement of 5 sec between Intervals from the tracks.csv file in a similar manner.

File 4: Converts the generated output file fcd.xml into the fcd_export.csv file.

File 5: Gives the Count of vehicles present on the road segment of 420m and their respective aggregate Speed every 60 sec with the displacement of 5 sec between Intervals from the fcd_export.csv file.

File 6: Converts the output of the E1-Loop detector (XML format) into CSV format for comparison with given HighD dataset.
